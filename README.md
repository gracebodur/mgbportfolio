# Marie Grace Bodur Portfoliio

### 
I wasn't happy with my professional portfolio being a hard-coded to the static personal site I built while working on my full-stack web development classes. While I've been job hunting, I've been building this site as a side project, and diving into aspects of front-end I love. It's built in React and CSS, incorporating react-reveal and react-scroll. This was the first project I deployed with Vercel and it was a breeze!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
